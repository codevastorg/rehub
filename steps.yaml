Step 1: Set Up the Frontend Environment
Initial HTML:
Open the index.html file.
Set up the basic HTML structure.
Include a script tag that will link to your main JavaScript file.
CSS:
Create a CSS file for styling (styles.css).
Link this CSS file in your index.html.
JavaScript:
Create a main.js file that will contain your frontend logic.
This file will handle DOM manipulation, event handling, and API requests.
Step 2: Define the User Interface
Layout:
Determine the layout of the application based on the functionality. You might need sections for user management, token operations, milestone tracking, etc.
Components:
Define the HTML components you will need, such as buttons, input fields, lists for displaying milestones and transactions, etc.
Modals/Popups:
If you need to display detailed information or forms, plan for modals or popups.
Step 3: Implement the API Interactions
Fetch API:
Use the fetch API in your main.js to interact with the backend canister's HTTP endpoints.
Create functions for each type of request you'll make to your backend (e.g., addUser, getUser, mintTokens).
Error Handling:
Implement error handling for your API requests to manage failed requests or issues with the backend.
Step 4: Frontend Logic
Dynamic Content:
Write JavaScript functions to dynamically create and update the DOM elements based on the data fetched from your backend.
Event Listeners:
Set up event listeners for user interactions, such as button clicks for submitting forms or requesting data.
Form Handling:
Manage form submissions and ensure they trigger the appropriate backend interactions.
Step 5: Styling the Frontend
CSS:
Write the CSS rules in your styles.css to style the application according to your wireframe designs.
Responsive Design:
Ensure your styles are responsive and provide a good user experience on various devices.
Step 6: Testing the Frontend
Manual Testing:
Test all interactions manually to ensure they behave as expected.
Use the browser's developer tools to troubleshoot and debug.
Automated Testing (Optional):
If you have the setup, write automated tests for your JavaScript functions.
Step 7: Optimization
Performance:
Optimize performance by minimizing reflows and repaints in the DOM.
Compress your CSS and JavaScript files for production.
Security:
Ensure that any sensitive actions are protected and any sensitive data displayed is properly sanitized.
Step 8: Deployment Preparation
Build Process:
If using a module bundler or build tool like Vite, set up the build process.
Test the build process to ensure it generates the output correctly.
Hosting:
Decide where you'll host your frontend. This could be the same as your backend or a different service.
Step 9: Review & Iterate
Code Review:
Go through your code to check for any issues or potential improvements.
Refactor code if necessary for readability and maintainability.
User Feedback:
If possible, get user feedback on the UI/UX and make adjustments as needed.
Step 10: Deployment
Upload Files:
Upload your built frontend files to your hosting service.
Configure the service as needed (e.g., setting up HTTPS).
Continuous Deployment (Optional):
If you have CI/CD, set this up to automate your deployment process.
